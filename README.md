# Name Convention String Converter (Work in Progress)
A regex-based tool for converting strings into different naming convention formats.

### Use-Case Examples:
1. Converting any style attribute name from inline HTML/CSS syntax (hyphenated)
to DOM element property syntax (camel-cased).
2. Converting strings from API endpoints that do not conform to an acceptable format for the particular parsing functions used by your application.
